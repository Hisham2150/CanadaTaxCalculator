# CanadaTaxCalcutor
Developed an Android based income tax calculator which calculates after tax income. The 10 provinces and 3 territories 
are represented by their individual flags. A user chooses his/her province or territory by clicking on one of the flags.
Once a user has chosen their respective location, they are prompted to enter their taxable income. Once the user submits 
their income and clicks the Calculate! button, the calculation process begins. The process is done by calculating Federal 
and provincial tax and CPP/EI. The app will then display the amount for each deductions and the userâ€™s after tax income.
